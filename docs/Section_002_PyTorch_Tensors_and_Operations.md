# Section: 2 PyTorch Tensors and Operations

## What is tensor?

- A kind of data structure => multidimensional arrays or matrices 
- With tensors you enocode all your parameters.

## Type Conversions

- Conversions from one datatype to another.
- Conversions from torch tensors to numpy arrays and vice versa.
